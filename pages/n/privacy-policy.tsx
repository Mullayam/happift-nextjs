              Happfit is an open-source library of UI components built with the
              utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes
              interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

              Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
              ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through
              before committing to an actual design project.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then I found a{" "}
              <a href="">
                component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite
              </a>
              . It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as
              buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are
              conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

            <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
            <p>
              First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This
              library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of
              components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from
              the documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive
              components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you
              can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can check out the{" "}
              <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">
                quickstart guide
              </a>{" "}
              to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your
              project. But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I
              recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
              purge and minify the generated CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Youll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI,
              and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your
              projects even faster. You can check out this{" "}

              to better understand the differences between the open-source and
              pro version of Flowbite.

            <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
            <p>
              While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are
              some key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to
                exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey
                and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
                usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact
                with your design once it’s live;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your
                GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype
                to your data protection team and they can test it for real;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help
                explain or even sell your idea by providing your client with a
                hands-on experience;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an
                interactive medium to preview and test design elements,
                designers and developers can understand each other — and the
                project — better.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
            <p>
              Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
              ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through
              before committing to an actual design project.

              Let s start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code>{" "}
              tag of your HTML.
            </p>
            <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
            <h4>Type properties</h4>
            <p>
              A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is
              unique, certain shapes are shared across letters. A typeface
              represents shared patterns across a collection of letters.
            </p>
            <h4>Baseline</h4>

            <h3>Type classification</h3>
            <h4>Serif</h4>
            <p>
              A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the
              beginning or end of a stroke on a letter. Typefaces with serifs
              are called serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of
              the following:
            </p>
            <h4>Old-Style serifs</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
              <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
              <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/typography-plugin/typography-image-2.png" />
            <ol>
              <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>

              <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Laying the best for successful prototyping</h3>
            <p>

              beginning:

                Flowbite is just awesome. It contains tons of predesigned
                components and pages starting from login screen to complex
                dashboard. Perfect choice for your next SaaS application.
              </p>

            <h3>Best practices for setting up your prototype</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to
              how close a prototype will be to the real deal. If you’re simply
              preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity
              prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some
              basic text — would be more than enough. But if you’re going for
              more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with
              on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed
              results.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user
              flow, try to think as your user would when interacting with your
              product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing,
              considering your user’s needs and habits early on will save you
              time by setting you on the right path.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both
              organize your tasks and create more user-friendly prototypes is by
              building your prototypes ‘inside out’. Start by focusing on what
              will be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image
              gallery, and list each element by order of priority. This way,
              you’ll be able to create a prototype that puts your users’ needs
              at the heart of your design.
            </p>

              prototypes — right in Flowbite Figma.
